# IoT Device Management System - User Guide

A simple system to monitor your IoT devices and sensors. This guide will help you set up your lands and devices step by step.

## üè† What This System Does

- **Monitor your devices**: Track temperature, humidity, location, and other sensors
- **Map visualization**: See where your devices are located on a map
- **Alerts**: Get notified when sensors go outside normal ranges
- **Land boundaries**: Check if devices are in the right locations

## üìã Step 1: Setting Up a Land

A "Land" is an area where you want to monitor devices (like a farm field, building, or garden).

### How to Create a Land:

1. **Go to Lands page**
   - Click "Lands" in the menu
   - Click "Create New Land"

2. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Land Name**: Give it a simple name (e.g., "North Field", "Greenhouse 1")
   - **Description**: What this area is used for
   - **Location**: You can add GPS coordinates if you know them
   - **Draw boundaries** (optional): If you want to check if devices stay within an area

3. **Save your land**
   - Click "Create Land"
   - Your land is now ready for devices

## üì± Step 2: Setting Up Devices

Devices are your sensors that send data (temperature, humidity, etc.).

### Device Types Available:

1. **MQTT Devices** (like ESP32, Arduino with WiFi)
2. **LoRaWAN Devices** (The Things Stack/TTN)
3. **Webhook Devices** (custom HTTP devices)

## üîß MQTT Devices (Most Common)

**Best for**: ESP32, Arduino with WiFi, Raspberry Pi

### How to Add an MQTT Device:

1. **Go to Devices page**
   - Click "Devices" ‚Üí "Create New Device"

2. **Basic Information**:
   - **Device ID**: A unique name (e.g., "temp_sensor_01")
   - **Device Name**: Friendly name (e.g., "Greenhouse Temperature Sensor")
   - **Land**: Choose the land you created
   - **Connection Type**: Select "MQTT"

3. **MQTT Settings**:
   - **MQTT Host**: `broker.emqx.io` (free public broker)
   - **Port**: `1883`
   - **Username**: Your MQTT username
   - **Password**: Your MQTT password
   - **Topic**: Where your device sends data (e.g., `greenhouse/sensors`)

4. **Save and Test**
   - Click "Create Device"
   - The system will try to connect

### What Your Device Should Send (MQTT Payload):

Your device needs to send data in JSON format. Here are the formats that work:

#### Format 1: Multiple Sensors (Recommended)
```json
{
  "sensors": [
    {"type": "temperature", "value": "25.6 celsius"},
    {"type": "humidity", "value": "60.2 percent"},
    {"type": "light", "value": "75 percent"}
  ]
}
```

#### Format 2: Simple Values
```json
{
  "temperature": 26.1,
  "humidity": 58.5,
  "light": 80.0
}
```

#### Format 3: Single Sensor
```json
{
  "sensor_type": "temperature",
  "value": 24.8,
  "unit": "¬∞C"
}
```

## üåê LoRaWAN Devices (The Things Stack)

**Best for**: Long-range, low-power devices

### How to Add a LoRaWAN Device:

1. **Set up in The Things Stack first**:
   - Create account at The Things Stack
   - Add your device there
   - Get device ID and keys

2. **Add to our system**:
   - **Device ID**: Same as in The Things Stack
   - **Connection Type**: Select "Webhook"
   - **Land**: Choose your land

3. **Configure webhook in The Things Stack**:
   - Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/lorawan/webhook`
   - Set format to JSON

### What Your LoRaWAN Device Should Send:

The Things Stack automatically formats the data like this:
```json
{
  "uplink_message": {
    "decoded_payload": {
      "data": {
        "temperature": 23.5,
        "humidity": 65.2,
        "battery": 85
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîó Webhook Devices (Custom)

**Best for**: Custom devices that can send HTTP requests

### How to Add a Webhook Device:

1. **Create device**:
   - **Connection Type**: Select "Webhook"
   - Get the webhook URL after creating

2. **Configure your device** to send HTTP POST to:
   `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhook/mqtt/your_device_id`

### What Your Webhook Device Should Send:
```json
{
  "device_id": "your_device_id",
  "sensors": [
    {
      "sensor_type": "temperature",
      "value": 25.6,
      "unit": "¬∞C"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üìä How Sensors Work

### Automatic Sensor Creation:
When your device sends data, the system automatically creates sensors for each type:

- **Temperature** ‚Üí Creates "Temperature Sensor" (¬∞C)
- **Humidity** ‚Üí Creates "Humidity Sensor" (%)
- **Light** ‚Üí Creates "Light Sensor" (%)
- **Pressure** ‚Üí Creates "Pressure Sensor" (hPa)
- **Latitude/Longitude** ‚Üí Creates GPS sensors for location

### Supported Sensor Types:
- `temperature` - Temperature readings
- `humidity` - Humidity percentage
- `light` - Light intensity
- `pressure` - Air pressure
- `soil_moisture` - Soil moisture percentage
- `ph` - pH levels
- `battery` - Battery percentage
- `latitude` - GPS latitude
- `longitude` - GPS longitude
- `altitude` - Height above sea level

### Setting Thresholds:
You can set minimum and maximum values for each sensor. The system will:
- Show **green** when values are normal
- Show **yellow** for low warnings
- Show **red** for high alerts

## üó∫Ô∏è Map Features

### Device Location:
- If your device sends GPS coordinates (`latitude` and `longitude`), it appears on the map
- The map shows your land boundaries (if you drew them)
- **Green alert**: Device is inside the land boundary
- **Red alert**: Device is outside the land boundary

### Map Tools:
- **Locate Device**: Centers map on your device
- **Measure Distance**: Click to measure distance from device to any point

---

## üö® Monitoring and Alerts

### Device Status:
- **Green (Online)**: Device is sending data
- **Red (Offline)**: No data received recently
- **Yellow (Maintenance)**: Device in maintenance mode

### Sensor Alerts:
- **Normal**: Values within expected range
- **Low Alert**: Value below minimum threshold
- **High Alert**: Value above maximum threshold

### Live Updates:
- **MQTT devices**: Update every 10 seconds
- **Webhook devices**: Update when data is received
- **Web page**: Refreshes automatically

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Device Not Connecting:
1. Check your MQTT broker settings
2. Verify username and password
3. Make sure your device can reach the internet
4. Check the topic name matches exactly

### No Data Appearing:
1. Verify your device is sending the correct JSON format
2. Check device status in the web interface
3. Make sure the device ID matches exactly

### Location Not Showing:
1. Your device must send both `latitude` and `longitude`
2. Values should be decimal degrees (e.g., 39.528865)
3. Check that GPS coordinates are valid

   - Type: MQTT
   - Host: `broker.emqx.io`
   - Topic: `garden/sensors`
3. **Device sends**:
   ```json
   {
     "sensors": [
       {"type": "temperature", "value": "22.5 celsius"},
       {"type": "humidity", "value": "65 percent"}
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Result**: Temperature and humidity sensors appear automatically
5. **Monitor**: Check web interface for live data
