# HiveMQ and EMQX Broker Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to remove HiveMQ and EMQX broker options from the user interface while preserving the underlying functionality for future use.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Interface Changes

#### Device Creation Form (`resources/views/application/devices/create.blade.php`)
- **Removed**: HiveMQ and EMQX options from the broker dropdown
- **Kept**: Mosquitto and The Things Stack options
- **Added**: Comment indicating HiveMQ and EMQX functionality is preserved

#### Device Edit Form (`resources/views/application/devices/edit.blade.php`)
- **Removed**: HiveMQ and EMQX options from the broker dropdown for new selections
- **Added**: Legacy support - existing devices with HiveMQ/EMQX will show as "(Legacy)" options
- **Preserved**: Ability to edit existing HiveMQ/EMQX devices without breaking them

#### Documentation (`resources/views/application/documentation.blade.php`)
- **Updated**: Example MQTT host from `broker.emqx.io` to `test.mosquitto.org`
- **Updated**: Setup examples to use Mosquitto instead of EMQX

### 2. Controller Validation Changes

#### DevicesController (`app/Http/Controllers/Application/DevicesController.php`)
- **store() method**: Validation now only allows `mosquitto` for new MQTT devices (The Things Stack removed as it only works with webhooks)
- **update() method**: Still allows `emqx`, `hivemq`, `mosquitto`, and `thethings_stack` for existing devices
- **Preserved**: All existing device functionality remains intact

### 3. Functionality Preservation

#### What Still Works
- **Existing HiveMQ/EMQX devices**: Continue to function normally
- **MQTT Connection Service**: All broker-specific logic preserved
- **Configuration**: HiveMQ and EMQX configurations remain in `config/mqtt.php`
- **Utilities**: Broker detection and handling logic preserved in `app/Traits/MqttUtilities.php`
- **Database**: Enum still supports all broker types

#### What Changed for Users
- **New device creation**: Users can only select Mosquitto or The Things Stack
- **Existing device editing**: Legacy HiveMQ/EMQX devices show as "(Legacy)" but remain editable
- **Documentation**: Examples now use Mosquitto instead of EMQX

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
- **No changes**: The `connection_broker` enum still supports all broker types
- **Migration preserved**: `2025_09_23_182746_add_mosquitto_to_connection_broker_enum.php` remains unchanged

### Backend Services
- **MqttConnectionService**: All broker-specific connection logic preserved
- **MqttUtilities trait**: Broker detection and configuration methods unchanged
- **Configuration**: All broker configurations remain in `config/mqtt.php`

### Validation Logic
```php
// New devices (store method)
'connection_broker' => 'nullable|in:mosquitto,thethings_stack',

// Existing devices (update method) 
'connection_broker' => 'nullable|in:emqx,hivemq,mosquitto,thethings_stack',
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Non-breaking**: Existing HiveMQ/EMQX devices continue to work
2. **Future-ready**: Code can be easily restored if needed
3. **Clean UI**: Users only see supported broker options
4. **Maintainable**: All broker logic remains in codebase for reference

## Files Modified

1. `resources/views/application/devices/create.blade.php`
2. `resources/views/application/devices/edit.blade.php`
3. `resources/views/application/documentation.blade.php`
4. `app/Http/Controllers/Application/DevicesController.php`

## Files Preserved (Functionality Intact)

1. `app/Services/MqttConnectionService.php`
2. `app/Traits/MqttUtilities.php`
3. `config/mqtt.php`
4. `database/migrations/2025_09_23_182746_add_mosquitto_to_connection_broker_enum.php`
5. All MQTT-related job and service files

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Existing devices**: Verify HiveMQ/EMQX devices still connect and function
2. **New device
